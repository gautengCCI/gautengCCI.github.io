# Gauteng Creative Sector Supportive Infrastructure Map

An interactive data-driven map visualising the supportive infrastructure for the Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs) in Gauteng, South Africa.  
The project highlights **government entities, associations, incubators, hubs, festivals, awards, residencies, and other initiatives** that create opportunities for creatives ‚Äî from open calls and mentorship programmes to collections and partnerships.  

The map was developed by [INCCA](https://incca.org.za), drawing on research from the **2024 Inclusive Economies Programme**, a collaboration between the **Gauteng City-Region Observatory (GCRO)** and the **Gauteng Department of Economic Development (GDED)**.
