# Gauteng Creative Sector Supportive Infrastructure Map

An interactive data-driven map visualising the supportive infrastructure for the Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs) in Gauteng, South Africa.  
The project highlights **government entities, associations, incubators, hubs, festivals, awards, residencies, and other initiatives** that create opportunities for creatives ‚Äî from open calls and mentorship programmes to collections and partnerships.  

The map was developed by [INCCA](https://incca.org.za), drawing on research from the **2024 Inclusive Economies Programme**, a collaboration between the **Gauteng City-Region Observatory (GCRO)** and the **Gauteng Department of Economic Development (GDED)**.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions that improve accuracy, add missing initiatives, or enhance UX. Please follow these guidelines so the dataset stays clean and the UI works reliably.

### 1. Ways to contribute
- Fix or update an entry (description, website, coordinates, categories/domains)  
- Add a new entry (ensure it fits the scope: supportive infrastructure for CCIs in Gauteng)  
- Improve UX/content (copy edits, accessibility, or component refinements)

### 2. Scope & inclusion criteria
Entries should be entities or initiatives that **support** CCIs, e.g.:  
- **Yes:** hubs, incubators, public programmes, networks, recurring awards, residencies, non-profits, tertiary/skills programmes tied to CCIs  
- **Sometimes:** museums, galleries, theatres, libraries, commercial venues or entities ‚Äî *only when* they run supportive programmes, have innovative platforms, are a social enterprise or provides supportive infrastructure (e.g. residencies, open calls)  
- **No:** purely commercial venues or one-off events without clear sector support

### 3. Taxonomy (required)
- **Categories** and **Domains** must match existing site values (to keep filters working)  
- Browse `/data/dataset.js` and reuse values exactly  
- If a new Category/Domain feels essential, open an issue first for discussion  

> **Rule:** *Domains and Categories must be existing on the site.* New terms require maintainers‚Äô approval before use.

### 4. Images 
- Place images in `/public/images/`  
- Use **lowercase filenames** (no spaces), e.g. `bagfactory.jpg`  
- Prefer ‚â§200KB optimised JPG/WEBP/PNG  
- Add `image` path in the entry: `"/images/yourfile.jpg"`  
- If no image is available, omit the field

### 5. Coordinates & ‚ÄúNomadic‚Äù
- Use decimal degrees for `lat` and `lon`  
- If the initiative has **no fixed site**, set `nomadic: true` and omit `lat`/`lon`  
- Nomadic entries will show a *‚ÄúNomadic / no fixed site‚Äù* badge

### 6. Entry checklist
When adding or editing an object in `/data/dataset.js`, check:

- [ ] `id` is unique, kebab-case  
- [ ] `name` is correct and official  
- [ ] `category` uses existing site values (1‚Äì4 max)  
- [ ] `domain` uses existing site values  
- [ ] `lat`/`lon` present **or** null for nomadic entities 
- [ ] `website` is HTTPS and live  
- [ ] `description` is concise yet notes why this entity contributes to the creative industries eco-system in Gauteng Province
- [ ] `image` (optional) lives in `/public/images/` and is optimised  

### 7. Submitting entry

1. **Fork** the repo and create a branch: `feat/add-bag-factory-update`  
2. Make edits to `/data/dataset.js` and add images in `/public/images/`  
3. Commit with a clear message, e.g.: 
4. Open a **Pull Request** describing changes and linking to sources  

---

### 9. Style & quality

- Keep descriptions factual; avoid hype  
- Use Title Case for names; sentence case for descriptions  
- Avoid trailing spaces or inconsistent commas  
- Run lint/format scripts before submitting  

---

### 10. Requesting corrections

If you represent an organisation and need an edit:  
- Open an issue with the required changes, or  
- Submit a PR with an updated entry and approved image + caption
