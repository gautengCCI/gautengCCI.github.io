Rooted in indigenous knowledge systems, Serati embraces natural fibres, botanical dyeing, and artisanal techniques as a way to reconnect with environment and heritage. Each collection is guided by dreams and ancestral intuition, such as the kimono inspired by a memory of Mashigo’s late grandmother. In 2019 she was commissioned to design costumes for the Grammy Award-winning Soweto Gospel Choir, employing over 15 women for the project. She later collaborated with Mr Price Home on a signature homeware line, expanding Serati’s storytelling into domestic design. Mashigo describes Serati as a form of narrative practice, where garments become vessels of spirit, soil, and identity. The label operates nomadically, staging projects, collaborations, and exhibitions across different platforms rather than a fixed studio base.",
